[XCompose](https://wiki.debian.org/XCompose) lets one type more complex stuff as easily as one could imagine, 
or include fancy Emojis all around the world...

### Where to find that so-called "Compose Key"

Check your OS for something called _Compose key_. One might find it, e.g. in Ubuntu _Settings_ ¬ª _Keyboard_ ¬ª 
_Special Character Entry_ ¬ª _Compose Key_. I have it set for `Right Alt` (aka `Alt Gr`) key.


### How to enable it?

On my Linux distro it was enough to simply create `~/.XCompose` configuration file and include there at least the 
following include statement:

```
include "/usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose"
```

Then one has to run simply:

```shell
ibus restart
```

And all the Compose Key shortcuts defined within the included file are already available for you. What is already
available, see some examples in the following subsection:


#### Some of the perhaps useful shortcuts for US

Something useful in general:
- NBSP (nonbreakable space): (_Compose key_, ` `, ` `)
- `‚Ä¶` (ellipsis): (_Compose key_, `.`, `.`)
- `‚Äî` (em dash): (_Compose key_, `-`, `-`, `-`)
- `¬∂` (pilcrow sign): case-insensitive (_Compose key_, `P`, `!`)
- `¬ß` (section sign): case-insensitive (_Compose key_, `o`, `s`), (_Compose key_, `s`, `o`) or (_Compose key_, `s`, `!`) 
- `¬±` (plus-minus sign): either (_Compose key_, `+`, `-`) or (_Compose key_, `-`, `+`)
- `‚Ç¨` (euro currency symbol): either (_Compose key_, `=`, `e`) or (_Compose key_, `e`, `=`)
- `¬£` (pound currency symbol): either case-insensitive (_Compose key_, `-`, `l`) or (_Compose key_, `l`, `-`)
- `¬©` (copyright): either (_Compose key_, `o`, `c`), (_Compose key_, `O`, `C`), or (_Compose key_, `C`, `O`)

Some special German characters and ligatures:
- `√§` (a with diaeresis): either (_Compose key_, `"`, `a`) or (_Compose key_, `a`, `"`)
- `√∂` (o with diaeresis): either (_Compose key_, `"`, `o`) or (_Compose key_, `o`, `"`)
- `√ü` (small sharp s): (_Compose key_, `s`, `s`)
- `·∫û` (capital sharp s): (_Compose key_, `S`, `S`)

Other special punctuation:
- `¬ø` (inverted question mark): (_Compose key_, `?`, `?`)
- `¬°` (inverted exclamation mark): (_Compose key_, `!`, `!`)

Arrows:
- `‚Üê` (leftwards arrow): (_Compose key_, `<`, `-`)
- `‚Üí` (rightwards arrow): (_Compose key_, `-`, `>`)
- `‚Üë` (upwards arrow): either (_Compose key_, `|`, `^`) or (_Compose key_, `^`, `|`)
- `‚Üì` (downwards arrow): either (_Compose key_, `|`, `v`) or (_Compose key_, `v`, `|`)
- `‚áê` (leftwards double arrow): (_Compose key_, `=`, `<`)
- `‚áí` (rightwards double arrow): (_Compose key_, `=`, `>`)
- `‚áë` (upwards double arrow): (_Compose key_, `=`, `^`)
- `‚áì` (downwards double arrow): (_Compose key_, `=`, `v`)

Fractions:
- `¬Ω` (one half): (_Compose key_, `1`, `2`)
- `‚Öì` (one third): (_Compose key_, `1`, `3`)
- `¬º` (one fourth): (_Compose key_, `1`, `4`)
- `¬æ` (three fourths): (_Compose key_, `3`, `4`)

Even some emojis:
- `‚ô•` (heart): (_Compose key_, `<`, `3`)
- `üññ` (long live): (_Compose key_, `L`, `L`, `A`, `P`)
- `üí©` (pile of poo): (_Compose key_, `p`, `o`, `o`)

### How to define some custom hotkeys?

Edit your `~/.XCompose` configuration file by some lines similar to the following example:

```
include "/usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose"

<Multi_key>     <f>     <r>     : "FREYAR-"
<Multi_key>     <n>     <n>     : "N/A"
<Multi_key>     <p>     <i>     : "ùõë"
<Multi_key>     <m>     <u>     : "Œº"
<Multi_key>     <l>     <m> <b> : "Œª"
<Multi_key>     <s>     <u> <m> : "Œ£"
<Multi_key>     <i>     <n> <f> : "‚àû"
<Multi_key>     <equal> <equal> : "‚â°"
<Multi_key>     <a>     <l> <l> : "‚àÄ"
<Multi_key>     <plus>  <1>     : "üëç"
<Multi_key>     <minus> <1>     : "üëé"
<Multi_key>     <o>     <k>     : "‚úÖ"
<Multi_key>     <n>     <o> <k> : "‚ùå"
<Multi_key>     <p>     <o> <i> : "‚åò"
```

A sequence of keys _Compose Key_ (e.g. `Alt Gr` in my case), `f`, and `r`, which will insert `FREAYR` text.
I had to write that word a lot and I tend to make there a typos, but since I used to this Compose Key shortcut, 
my life was a bit easier...

Similar custom rule is on each line of the given example. I sometimes would like to write Œ£ (meaning sum),
Œº (meaning "micro"), Œª (meaning Greek letter lambda used e.g. in Functional Paradigm), ‚àû (meaning infinity),
‚â° (meaning infinity), and so on. Define as many shortcuts as you want.


#### Syntax of XCompose file

Each non-empty line defines exactly one shortcut. Each shortcut definition consists of three parts:
- sequence of "key codes" (input/encoding sequence),
- colon `:` as a separator
- and the output text delimiter by double quotes `"`.

_Compose Key_ is represented by `<Multi_key>`.

As one can see letters are case-sensitive and they are denoted simply as `<a>` or `<A>`.
Each key representing more complex character has to be written by a word. Here is listed a few of those:

| key                 | placeholder     |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| ` `                 | `<space>`       |
| `+`                 | `<plus>`        |
| `-`                 | `<minus>`       |
| `=`                 | `<equal>`       |
| `(`                 | `<parenleft>`   |
| `)`                 | `<parenright>`  |
| `,`                 | `<comma>`       |
| `:`                 | `<colon>`       |
| `.`                 | `<period>`      |
| `?`                 | `<question>`    |
| `!`                 | `<exclam>`      |
| `'`                 | `<apostrophe>`  |
| `"`                 | `<quotedbl>`    |
| `<`                 | `<less>`        |
| `>`                 | `<greater>`     |
| `^`                 | `<asciicircum>` |
| `*`                 | `<asterisk>`    |
| `%`                 | `<percent>`     |
| `/`                 | `<slash>`       |
| `\`                 | `<backslash>`   |
| `_`                 | `<underscore>`  |
| <code>&#124;</code> | `<bar>`         |
